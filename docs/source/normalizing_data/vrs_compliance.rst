VRS Compliance
==============

As mentioned earlier in the documentation, the Gene Normalizer incorporates structures from the `GA4GH Variation Representation Specification (VRS) <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/stable/>`_ to integrate more smoothly with other related libraries. The Gene Normalizer is currently released in two branches, corresponding to different VRS releases:
