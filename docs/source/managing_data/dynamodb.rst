DynamoDB
========

The Gene Normalizer can store and retrieve gene records from a `local DynamoDB <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html>`_ database. See the `instructions for deploying and running DynamoDB <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.DownloadingAndRunning.html>`_ in the AWS docs for more information.

Once a DynamoDB local instance is running, use the environment variable ``GENE_NORM_DB_URL`` to direct the Gene Normalizer to it. In the environment where you call the gene normalizer, run the following command (assuming DynamoDB service on port 8000): ::

    export GENE_NORM_DB_URL=http://localhost:8000


Specifying port number
-------------------------------

Note that by default, DynamoDB Local serves to port 8000, which is the same port as the Uvicorn default. This means that when running the Gene Normalizer with DynamoDB, you may have to use a different port for one of those services. To do so with DynamoDB, use the ``-port`` option: ::

    java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb -port 8001


Managing DynamoDB shared-local-instance file
--------------------------------------------

DynamoDB Local will store all data in a file named ``shared-local-instance.db`` when called with the ``sharedDb`` parameter. This file persists after the database process ends and can be shared with other users. An alternate directory can be provided with the ``dbPath`` option if the DB file is stored in a different directory, e.g.: ::

    java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb -dbPath ../other_directory/
